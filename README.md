## Special instructions:

### For eFridge:
- Since the last updated component doesn't update with the fridge component, you will have to change both.
- Anything in the eFridge is editable.

### For Profile:
- Only the first two "Percent to Remove" fields are responsive due to time constraints, so please only use those for testing.

### For Saved Recipes
- The delete button is currently under development

### For Edit View Page
- Due to a bug, the delete buttons only work properly if they're used in ascending order. Other buttons are fully functional. The recipe doesn't actually save since its only an example and the service isn't fully developed with accounts.

### For the search page
- The filters only have "simualted" functionality since we dont have backend database to use them on. The user can see how recipes appear and disappear when the filters are adjusted, but they do not do so in any logical manner.
- The "More Info" button was not developed due to time constraints
